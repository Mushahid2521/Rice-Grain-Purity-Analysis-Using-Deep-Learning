# Rice Grain Purity Analysis Using Deep Learning
In this repository we represent the ![paper]() ```An automatic rice grain purity analysis system``` .One of the significant factor of a rice grain purity is measured by the percentage of foreign grains mixture. Most of the Rice traders used to verify the purity of rice grain by Manual annotations done by labours with the years of experience. But this process is Costly and produce erronous result in most cases. Which also takes very long time. So ths work is going find the purity of a Rice sample within a second and with a very good accuracy from a scanned image of the sample. 
The ultimate result will detect each grains and classify it to its corresponding grain type.
